Important commands:
      Docker:
          docker ps
          docker images
          docker logs <container_name>
          docker exec -it <container_name> sh
          docker -v // docker version


      DockerCompose:
          docker-compose up 
          docker-compose up --build
          docker-compose down
          docker-compose restart
          docker-compose ps
          docker-compose logs <service_name>
          docker-compose exec <service_name> sh
          docker-compose version // docker compose version




How do files and filepaths work? 

Dockerfile:
    Defines how a container is going to be built by creating a docker IMAGE. Can specify commands to run, server distributions to use, or installation requirements. 
    Images need to be rebuilt when modifying code. 

docker-compose.yml:
    Yaml file that defines and manages the container. In the customers example, it creates a container based of the customer image we created, as well as using a public image for the mariadb database. 
    Also can attach volumes to the containers from the filesystem and exposes ports. (8000 for FastAPI, 3306 for MariaDB). 
    Enables communication between python and mariadb. 

Main.py:
    Uses FastAPI to enable JSON communication in and out.
    Uses pymysql to enable easy sql statements into the mariadb database. 
    Uses uvicorn server to run FastAPI on. 

requirements.txt:
    Simply gives the python requirements that the dockerfile uses to install into the container. 

db/init.sql:
    Initializes database. It's imporant to note that docker-compose.yml copies this file into the mariadb container where it is executed. 


Webpage:
    webpage/login.html:
        This is used for creating the login page where customer are able to first log into the website. 
        This was used making HTML and Bootstrap for easier and responsive design.
        
    webpage/login.css:
        This is creating the design and resizing the the differnt strucure of the HTML file.
